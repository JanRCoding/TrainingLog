This project is meant to help structure workouts, automate scheduling of overloads according to preset paradigms and keep note of failed lifts.

Based off of preset trainingdays and adjustable overload paradigms the program creates a workoutschedule, which can then be further adjusted to reflect any kind of struggle with the current set of weights. Failures can be noted and weights of following sessions can be adjusted to the new current weight if desired.

In its current concept stage only the main body of the scheduler exists. Long term it is meant to be an organizational tool to improve accountability. For that adding a clear and concise UI is the top priority. Additional paradigms will be added as well as a factory for custom excercises and database for storing preset workouts and routines.
